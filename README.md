5. Once you have chosen your desired URL. You will be prompted to a window with information about that specific URL. You can see how many total clicks came from your shortned URL and how many UNIQUE people have looked at your URL. If you wish to edit your destination URL you can edit it to whatever you like. Clicking on the short URL will send you to your destination.

   _please read disclaimer for editing rules_
